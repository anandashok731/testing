            <h2>What Saturday on Hacker News Looks Like</h2>
            <p>Yesterday, a post I had submitted to Hacker News got
                pushed up to the front page. Outside of retiring and basking in my new-found internet fame, I wanted to 
                show what a few hours on the front-page looks like

            <h2>Home Made Standing Desk Raspberry Pi Controller</h2>
            <p>One of my lockdown projects was to make my <sit>stand controller smart. I used a Raspberry Pi to create a custom controller that 
                could control the motor on my desk and allow me to rise and lower it
                over the networks as well as via a touch-interface

            <h2>Saving Your Initial Reaction</h2>
            <p>This is very simply idea that has helped me in a number of different ways 
                in the recent past:recording my initial reaction to things. All this means is immediately saving my thoughts on a topic somewhere, as opposed to the usual ... "I'll write this down later"

            <h2>Sending Ember actions down to components</h2>
            <p>"Data down,action up" is an often repeated mantra of the Ember community, and for good reason.
                Some-times though , you need to call action on components in a "downward" direction. 
            In this post I'll give you an approach for breaking this DDAU rule </p>

            <h2>"Route variable" pattern with Ember</h2>
            <p>There are a couple of different libraries for Ember that add the ability to set 
                the page title for each page in your application by simply creating a 'title'
                property on each route. This is a great general purpose pattern for declarative information that needs to be set 
                across routes. For example you might want to add breadcrumbs, or just a different heading on each page. 
                This post will outline how to go about creating this pattern yourself.
